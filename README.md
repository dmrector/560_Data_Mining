# Project Two – Developing a Data Mining Portfolio -  End to End Project– Classification
# Description.
# This project involves generating several classification models for the same data set and then combining the output from the models in an ensemble fashion.    An r file is provided that generates classification models using the Iris data set.  You will want to adapt this for the BreastCancer data set which is provided.  You will want to add code that combines the output from the different models using Majority rule ensemble approach. 
# As a motivation for this assignment, use this as part of your data mining portfolio.   So, as you do your work you may want to follow the guidance in the Project Twodataminingportfolio.doc file with the objective of using this project as part of building a data mining portfolio.   In particular, the following relevant for this assignment  from the doc file –
# An end to end project takes in and processes data, then generates some output.  This involves developing data mining models using machine learning algorithms – here you are using classification.
# Here are typical steps you’ll need to follow to build a good end to end project:
# •	Find an interesting topic – You won’t focus on a single static dataset, so you’ll want to find a topic instead such as flights, electricity pricing, health.  – Call it health in this case 
# •	Import and parse multiple datasets -  Here you are using the breastcancer data set
# •	Create classifications or predictions.   Determine the needed features and create training and test data.  Using that to make predictions or classifications.  – base this on the breastcancer dataset.
# •	Clean up and document your code”
# For your project assignment this will involve documenting, generating RMarkdown output, and posting your work on Github including posting your work on Canvas.
# Deliverables   - submit on Canvas the .rmd and Output form the Knit and include your Github link.
